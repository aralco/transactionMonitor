TRANSACTION MONITOR
************************************************************************************************************************
Requirements:
    a. MySQL server 5.x installed and configured.
    b. citi and citiuser schemas running onMySQL server.
    c. Java SDK 1.6.0_37
    d. Maven 3.0.x installed.

Installation:
    1. Go to terminal console, login to mysql command line, there you can run the “databaseSchema.sql” file in order to
    have the transactionQueueDB created.
    2. After that make sure that “database.properties” file matches your databases configuration.
    3. Also make sure to check “query.properties” file, so that  location for sql scripts matches your local
    configuration. Also be careful to set query.from_time and query.to_time values according to your sql queries.
    4. For sql script queries make sure that all of them have the names like {COMMENT.sql, EMAIL_HISTORY.sql, REPLY.sql,
    TELL_A_FRIEND.sql, IDEA.sql, TESTIMONIAL.sql, etc}. Each one representing a transaction type.
    5. At this step all queries MUST replace from_time and to_time date values with @from_time and @to_time variables.
    6. After that you should be ready to package the TransactionMonitor. To do it you should go to the terminal console
    and under the folder “spigit” you must run the following commands:
        - $mvn clean
        - $mvn package
    7.	If succesfull a “target” folder will be created under spigit folder.
    8.	Assuming you are still on “spigit” folder run the following command in order to run TransactionMonitor:
    9.	From terminal console execute the following command to run TransactionMonitor:
        - $java –jar target/TransactionMonitor.one-jar.jar
    10.	At this point TransactionMonitor will retrieve data from citi and citiusers databases and will populate
    “transactionQueueDB”. TransactionQueue and TransactionQueryHistory tables will be populated:

Changes:
- Updated csv field type from BLOB to LONGBLOB on ReconciliationReportLog table. (databaseSchema.sql)
- Fixed Email History query. (EMAIL_HISTORY.sql)
- Some code improvements on file (TransactionMonitor.java)
- Added a property entry on (spring-config.xml)
